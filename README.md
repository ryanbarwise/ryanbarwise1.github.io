# responsive-portfolio



In this project, I was tasked with creating my own responsive portfolio.  I was given an original example, which I was asked to reproduce with my own code. I accomplished this with the help of the Bootstrap framework.  In my project I took advantage of Bootstrap's card component system, as well as its grid and form systems.  The project consists of three html files which represent a profile page, a portfolio page for future projects, and a contact page. There is also an additional css file which links to all three html files.
